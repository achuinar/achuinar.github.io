  <h1 class="postTitle">Impact Parameters</h1>
  <p class="meta">January 03, 2018 | <span class="time">5</span> Minute Read</p>
  
  <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the fundamental things you learn as a physicist is that not everything matters.  Interactions depend on the magnitude of the typical quantities driving the physics behind them. The magnitudes of forces, times, distances and energies involved in physical systems determine how one should approach and model nature. Considering, for instance, that the ground is flat is a perfectly valid hypothesis if you are a civil engineer hired to build a house with a floor at level. We know however that the earth is round and the ground is far from being flat, but the curvature of our planet can be neglected at the scale of the plot you are building the house on.
</p>
<p>Those principles extend to almost all fields we know. Microeconomics, which studies the economical interactions of individuals and firms, and macroeconomics, which considers the same type of interactions but at the scale of a country or a region, are for instance driven by very different mathematical models. Climate and weather are another example. Although we know that green gases in the atmosphere are responsible for the global rise in temperatures on Earth, predicting the temperature in Montreal tomorrow is another story.  Quite often, the interplay between a large-scale behavior and small-scale effects is very complicated to understand and to model.
</p>
<p>
We often build our judgment on phenomena based on the context we live in, which explains why people in North America become more skeptical about 'global warming' during gnarly winters. Sometimes, the scale bias causes us to adopt useless or even counterproductive behaviors. This is particularly true when it comes to considering our environmental footprint. Listening to the news, many things we are encouraged to do in order to save the planet turn out having very little impact at the end of the day. On the other hands, there are less obvious ideas that very few talk about, which I believe can be game-changers if implemented at large scales. </p>
<p>
I listed those that appeared to be the most relevant in terms of impact. The metrics that quantify such impact of course depends on a number of parameters, and to simplify, I considered the case of a couple of millennials leaving in a developed country, which corresponds to the majority of my readership. 
</p>

<p class="intro"> 1. Rethink the concept of family</p>
<p>
A study from 2017 in the journal <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">Environmental Research Letters</a> showed that having one less kid had 20 times more impact on your global footprint than living car free. Although the desire to have a natural child is quite often irrational, the decision to build a family is most of the time thought ahead of time. Being able to welcome and raise a child is quite, if not the most, interesting challenge to take in life. What if the kid was already born?
Earth is overpopulated. We would need 3,5 earths to fulfill all our needs if everyone consumed as much as the average US citizen. Niger, Mali and Uganda have the highest birth rate in the world, they are also among the countries with the lowest schooling rate. It does not sound to me like a crazy idea to adopt a child from one of these countries, instead of making my own naturally. If, for you, making a family is about giving love more than reproducing yourself and if you are ready to endure the paperwork, then this might be an option. </p>

<p class="intro">2. Reconsider the environment you wish to live in </p>
<p>
It might sound like being a life goal to have a house in the suburbs or on the countryside, but it is actually a terrible idea in terms of the impact on the environment. First of all, living far from the city means you are more likely to drive to work, to the shopping mart, to the school of your kids etc.  Public transportation is logically less developed in less populated areas. Unless you buy it on local market, most of the food you eat will have traveled from a large city distribution center to your plate, which is also far from being ideal. In dense habitats, most of the infrastructure is mutualized which makes it interesting in terms of energy savings. For instance, a large number of adjoining appartments will have a minimized heat loss compared to many small isolated houses. It looks like our future is in the city!
</p>

<p class="intro"> 3. Watch your money </p>
<p>Next time you worry about taking too much time showering, you would be better at thinking about where to place your savings instead. You probably heard in the news about large french banking groups like BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole recently pledged to stop financing companies whose main activity stems from oil and natural gas from shale or tar sands (If you did not, have a look <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/bnp-paribas-to-halt-shale-oil-financing-in-climate-change-pledge"> here</a>. ). This is quite a pioneering policy though. In 2016, the world largest banks still lent $87 bn to oil, coal and gas companies. A report, entitled <a href="http://priceofoil.org/2017/06/21/banking-on-climate-change/">Banking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2017</a> stated that meeting the Paris Agreement's target of staying well under a 2°C increase in global temperature, would require a complete halt to all financing on such extreme fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure. In parallel, a report from the french branch of <a href="http://financeresponsable.org/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=4">Friends of the Earth international</a>, showed that owning as little as 5000 euros on a Livret A (savings account) in 2015 at the french bank Credit Agricole was equivalent to driving a small truck instead of biking to work in term of greenhouse effect gas emissions. Ethical banks are on a roll, they are just waiting for us!</p>
