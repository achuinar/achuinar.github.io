      <h2 class="pageTitle">Hello there,</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Anabel. I am a swiss-french, canadian by heart, artist and physicist and I want to make the world a better place</p>
      
      <p>I am a particle physicist from the <a href="https://atlas.cern/"> ATLAS experiment</a>, soon to be graduated from <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University</a>.  I also have a master in cooking from my alma mother, with a minor in late dinner with friends and nerd anthropology. I would say I am very curious about how things work and how entities in our universe interact, this including human beings!

      <p>Places where we are humbled by the beauty of nature are those where I draw my energy from. I think humanity has all it takes to solve the climate crisis and preserve our planet, as long as we believe we can make a difference. For this reason, and for many others, I spent quite some time during my PhD, writing and teaching people about the beauty of science, the fun aspects of collaboration and the importance of being rational when it comes to make decisions for the future of our world.

      <p>These five years spent collaborating with many different people on physics projects at the frontier of the unknown tought me a few things about life goals and expectations:
	<ul>    
	  <li> No matter where you start from, any objective can be achieved with a decent amount of self-confidence AND coffee.
	  <li> Failure does not define you. Persistence does.
	  <li> There are no misfits. There are only interesting people. 
	</ul>
